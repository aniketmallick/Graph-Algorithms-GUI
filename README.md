# Graph-Algorithms-GUI
GUI implemented with Graph Algorithms

Developed a desktop software which helps in drawing and editing the graphs by mouse click and keyboard interrupts in GUI mode. 
Various operations can be selected using buttons provided, like shortest path between two vertices in the graph can be computed using the provided objects(shapes).
On loading the queries, objects will move graphically from the initial to final vertices along the shortest path, implemented using Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm.
